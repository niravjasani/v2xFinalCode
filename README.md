Abstract:-
=========
	By creating geo-fancing accross the hazardous zones, system calculates the current distance from the each geo-fancing using GPS and emerges a visual alarm on the display as a warnin according to threshold value of distance set by the system.

System overview:-
================
	Problem:
		Sometimes even if a person knows the fact that hazardous(accdent possible area) zone is about to come during driving, he or she just forgot it and its natural.There are more than 100 hazardous zones in the waterloo region. It’s been more than 6300 crashes happened in 2018 (Data according to govt of waterloo region and  CTV news -Kitchener) and it took more than $100,000 social cost. Here is the solution to the actual problem on a small scale (by selecting top 5 hazardous zone) to save precious lives and taxpayer’s money.

	Solution :
		we are proposing is by calculating distance between current location and hazardous zones using GPS system sends the visual alarm before user/driver about to enter those zones. It’s a modular concept which is going to fit in the car and it continuously monitor the real-time GPS data.
